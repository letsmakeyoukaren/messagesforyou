Hey Karen, this will be my first message to you. I have 3 minutes left to write so let's get to it. Work today went pretty well overall. I've been studying Bash and Git for the past few days but need to move on to working on homework assignments quickly. I will try to begin skimming content for my combinatorics course before I sleep today.

Karen, there are so many different ways to learn something nowadays that it's difficult to know how to establish what I can accept as an efficient and stable study pattern for anything. I've decided that I only need to read the bare minimum needed to start being able to solve problems. I think problems aren't a supplement to the text but rather, the text is a supplement to the problems.

Hi Karen, I still haven't begun working on assignments due this week yet. I'm spending more time on the problems in this Combinatorics textbook than I would like. I forgot about my meeting with Maimi this morning, I will try to finish all my homework tomorrow so I can meet her on Wednesday. Let's start on actual work.

Why did I not finish my assignments before messing around with Git and trying to speedrun unassigned Combinatorics problems?!?! I swear that I will finish all homework assignments due within the next 7 days before spending my time on anything that has no effect on my GPA. I swear. Really! Please watch over me Karen, I tend to get lost when I'm let loose alone.

Hi Karen! I thought my research today was rather messy and unorganized but I think it wasn't too bad. I haven't even started writing an outline for the introduction of my ESE 231 paper yet though, so I'll have to try to focus on only reading information and papers closely related to carbon nanotubes. I'll try my best tomorrow to not be distracted too easily, really! Good night, Karen!
